For `Content.Server` code:

- Keep authority, round rules, persistence, and server-only side effects here.
- If the local player should feel the action immediately, verify the shared prediction path instead of leaving the behavior server-only by accident.
- Load `ss14-tests-authoring` when the behavior change is risky enough to warrant coverage.
- Pair player-facing server behavior with prototype and locale updates in the same change.
