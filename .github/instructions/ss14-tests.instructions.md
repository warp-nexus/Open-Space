For tests:

- Load `ss14-tests-authoring`.
- Prefer the smallest test layer that meaningfully covers the behavior.
- Use `Content.Tests` for parsing, shared logic, and content-loading checks.
- Use `Content.IntegrationTests` only when the behavior truly depends on runtime orchestration or multi-side interaction.
