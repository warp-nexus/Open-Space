# Entity Query Patterns

## Prefer

- `EntityQueryEnumerator<...>()` for hot iteration
- querying only the components you need
- state components or marker components for fast filtering

## Rule

Do not rebuild a broad polling loop when an existing event or narrower query can already drive the behavior.
