# SS14 Standard Optimizations

Use this skill when performance matters, especially in frequent event handlers or update paths.

## Workflow

1. Open `references/optimization-checklist.md`.
2. Open `references/event-hotpath-patterns.md` for frequent handlers.
3. Open `references/entity-query-patterns.md` for high-volume iteration.
2. Keep the optimization local to the actual hot path.
3. Do not trade away correctness or prediction safety for micro-optimizations without evidence.
