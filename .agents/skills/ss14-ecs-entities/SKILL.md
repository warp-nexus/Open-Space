# SS14 ECS Entities

Use this skill when a task is about entity ownership, entity-system method signatures, `Resolve(...)`, `TryComp(...)`, or safe entity/component access.

## Workflow

1. Open `references/entity-api-patterns.md`.
2. Prefer `Entity<T?>` when the call site already has the component pair.
3. Resolve optional components early in the method.
4. Keep owner, user, used, target, and performer naming consistent with nearby systems.
