# Integration Test Anchors

## Good Starting Points

- `Content.IntegrationTests/Fixtures/GameTest.cs`
- `Content.IntegrationTests/PoolManager.cs`
- `Content.IntegrationTests/Tests/CargoTest.cs`

## Use These For

- entity spawning and lifecycle
- server-client or roundflow behavior
- system interactions that need a real runtime harness

## Pattern Reminder

Prefer an integration test only when the bug or feature truly depends on runtime orchestration. If a smaller shared/content test can cover the behavior, use that instead.
