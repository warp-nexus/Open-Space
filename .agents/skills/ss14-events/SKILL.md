# SS14 Events

Use this skill when a task adds or changes event types, subscriptions, relays, or event-driven architecture.

## Workflow

1. Open `references/event-patterns.md`.
2. Prefer public system methods over method events when a direct API is clearer.
3. Use by-ref events for cancellable or mutable flows when that is already the project pattern.
4. Keep event names explicit and feature-scoped.
